            <p class="title title-main3">WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</p>
            <p class="title-main4 tab-left">
                We collect personal information in a variety of ways. For example, you may provide us your personal information when you place an order, register for an account or loyalty membership, make an online purchase, post a review, send us messages, subscribe to our mailing lists, newsletters or other forms of marketing communications, submit a job application, participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes, redeem a promotion, or use some other feature of our Service.
                <br><br>
                We may link or combine your activities and information collected from you on our websites and mobile apps with information we have collected from you offline (e.g., in-store), information we receive from third parties, as well as information we collect automatically through tracking technologies (defined below). In some countries, we may also utilize session-replay technologies, which are software code to log your interactions with the Sites in a manner that allows us to reproduce your click mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during sessions.  This information allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us, and helps us diagnose any usability problems to improve our Service. These third party partners may include FullStory, Google Analytics, Microsoft, and Splunk whose privacy choice procedures may be available on their websites.
            </p>
            <p class="title title-main3">HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
            <p class="title-main4 tab-left">
                To monitor, improve and develop our products and services.  We may use your information to understand our visitors and customers and tailor our product offerings accordingly. We may use your interactions with our Services as the basis for developing new customer service capabilities; for example, by using records of your website chats with our chatbot or phone call recordings with our customer service team to train artificial intelligence customer service. Your personal information may be used in combination with Yum! Brands, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and Brands personal information and transactions in order to understand our visitors, customers, and product responses. From time to time, we analyze statistics and trends to make our Sites and Services better and to develop new services or features.
                <br><br>
                To fulfill your requests and provide our Services to you. For example, we or our franchisees may use your information to complete your order or other online and in-store transactions, deliver orders you place online, or respond to your customer service requests or feedback. We may also use your information to personalize your experience with us and facilitate our rewards or loyalty programs.  We also use this information to provide the Service to you across our operations, including by supporting your in-store experience when you engage with our franchisee-owned locations.
            </p>
            <p class="title title-main3">HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</p>
            <p class="title-main4 tab-left">
                <b>Data storage and transfer:</b>  Your information collected through our Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Yum! Brands, its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities.  If you are located in regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that have data protection laws that may be more or less restrictive than those required under U.S. law.  
                <br><br>
                <b>Keeping your information safe:</b>  Security of your information is very important to us, and we have put in place safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information we collect and share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems at all times. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of data security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take additional steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
